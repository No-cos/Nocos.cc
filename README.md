# Nocos.cc

Discovering and contributing to non-code open-source issues presents several challenges. Many potential contributors are unaware of opportunities beyond code, and platforms like GitHub are often perceived as code-centric. Lack of clear pathways for non-coders, insufficient project documentation, and limited awareness about non-code contributions hinder participation. Bridging this gap requires improved project visibility, dedicated spaces for non-code tasks, and education to encourage a diverse range of contributors to engage effectively in open source.

# E.g of Non-code Contributions

1.  Design,
2.  Documentation,
3.  Testing/Quality Assurance,
4.  User Support,
5.  Project Management,
6.  Content Creation,
7.  Accessibility Auditing,
8.  Marketing and Promotion of OS Projects,
9.  Data Analysis,
10. Content Management,
11. Localization and Translation, etc.
